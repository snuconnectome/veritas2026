The most authoritative documents are:
1. `veritas_research_plan_summary.md` - Comprehensive integrated plan
2. `_연구개발계획서.docx` - Current official proposal
3. `emails.md` - Faculty communication and agreements
4. Reference papers for theoretical grounding

### Key Decision Points Documented
- Prof. Jeon's participation adds language/cognition module (Module 3)
- Prof. Han So-won participating in development but not teaching (conflict of interest as committee member)
- Dr. Lee Yoon-kyung available as research assistant and guest lecturer
- Dopamine-driven training philosophy over cortisol-driven training
- Focus on student as scientists, policymakers, engineers, journalists

### Language & Cultural Context
- Primary language: Korean (한국어)
- Target population: Korean university students (Seoul National University)
- Cultural specificity: Korean educational pressure, competition culture, generational gaps
- Bilingual materials: Korean for implementation, English for research dissemination

## Notes for Future Iterations

This is a **course development project**, not a software codebase. When working with these materials:

- Respect the interdisciplinary nature: neuroscience + clinical + developmental + cognitive science
- Maintain consistency with the approved budget and timeline
- Preserve the student-centered, data-driven learning philosophy
- Keep existential themes as organizing framework
- Ensure all modules integrate team-teaching approach
- Document IRB and ethical considerations for any data collection activities
- Reference external research (Lancet, Nature papers) appropriately
