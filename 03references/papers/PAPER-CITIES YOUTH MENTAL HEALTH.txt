Urban life shapes the mental health of city dwellers, and although cities provide
access to health, education and economic gain, urban environments are often
detrimental to mental health1,2. Increasing urbanization over the next three decades
will be accompanied by a growing population of children and adolescents living in
cities3. Shaping the aspects of urban life that influence youth mental health could have
an enormous impact on adolescent well-being and adult trajectories4. We invited a
multidisciplinary, global group of researchers, practitioners, advocates and young
people to complete sequential surveys to identify and prioritize the characteristics
of a mental health-friendly city for young people. Here we show a set of ranked
characteristic statements, grouped by personal, interpersonal, community,
organizational, policy and environmental domains of intervention. Life skills for
personal development, valuing and accepting young people’s ideas and choices,
providing safe public space for social connection, employment and job security,
centring youth input in urban planning and design, and addressing adverse social
determinants were priorities by domain. We report the adversities that COVID-19
generated and link relevant actions to these data. Our findings highlight the need for
intersectoral, multilevel intervention and for inclusive, equitable, participatory
design of cities that support youth mental health.

More than a decade ago, Galea posed the question “Can we improve mental health if we improve cities?”4. In the past two centuries, urbanization
has shaped landscapes and lives, making it the “sentinel demographic
shift” of our times4. The relationships between mental health status
and the social, cultural and physical environment have been explored
for at least as long; nineteenth-century researchers proposed environmental exposures as possible explanations of ‘insanity’5. Faris and Dunham’s classic 1930s study6 linked social disorganization and unstable
communities to mental disorders. Two decades later, Leonard Duhl
sought to create healthy societies through liveable cities, informing the
World Health Organization’s Healthy Cities initiative7,8. The question
remains pertinent today even as we recognize the multiple and complex forces that shape mental health9. Today we understand that urban
environments influence a broad range of health outcomes for their

populations, positively and negatively, and this impact is manifested
unequally10. Opportunities for education and connection exist for some,
whereas rising levels of urban inequality, violence, stressful racial or
ethnic dynamics in urban neighbourhoods, exposure to environmental
toxins, lack of green space, inadequate infrastructure and fear of displacement increase risk for poor mental health and disproportionately
affect marginalized groups11. Disparate outcomes also pertain to distinct
developmental stages, and the mental health of adolescents and young
adults is particularly vulnerable to urban exposures.

Adolescents, youth and urban mental health
Young people under the age of 25 are the demographic group most
likely to move to cities for educational and employment opportunities,

Analysis
and by 2050 cities will be home to 70% of the world’s children3. Cities
concentrate innovation3 and have long been considered the consummate source of skills, resources and talent12. They offer greater opportunities for health and economic development, education, employment,
entertainment and social freedoms (that is, the ‘urban advantage’), but
rapid urbanization also deepens disparities and exposes individuals to
considerable adversity, placing their mental health at risk13. In fact, most
evidence points to urban living as a risk factor for poorer mental health,
yielding increased risk for psychosis, anxiety disorders and depression1,2. Adolescence and young adulthood, specifically, encompass a
critical period of risk for the incidence of mental disorders: an estimated
half of mental disorders evident before age 65 begin in adolescence and
75% begin by age 24 (ref. 14). Mental disorders are the leading causes
of disease burden among 10–24-year-olds worldwide15, responsible for
an estimated 28.2 million disability-adjusted life years globally, with
1 disability-adjusted life year being equivalent to a healthy year of life
lost to the disability caused by mental disorders. Public awareness
of these issues rose as the incidence of mental disorders and suicide
increased in some countries among adolescents and young adults
during the coronavirus pandemic16,17. Urban environments probably
have a role in these processes.
Fundamental to adolescents’ growth and development are their
interactions with the complex urban environment: physical, political, economic, social and cultural18. Adolescents have a heightened
sensitivity to context and social evaluation, and a stronger neural
response to social exclusion, as well as to threat and reward stimuli19,
and it is plausible that they may be particularly sensitive to social and
environmental cues in the urban context, such as discrimination or
violence. Discriminatory policies and norms are entrenched in many
of the institutions with which young people interact (for example,
schools, housing, justice and policing), and minoritized youth may
experience the emotional and mental health consequences20. In fact,
in settings of structural inequality (for example, high neighbourhood
poverty and unemployment), young people are at greater risk for low
self-efficacy and feelings of powerlessness and depression21. Social
cohesion and collective efficacy can reduce the effects of concentrated
disadvantage and nurture social and emotional assets among young
people, families and their networks21.
At present, the world’s largest population of adolescents and young
adults so far is growing up amid the sequelae of a tenacious pandemic,
rapid population growth in urban centres and increasing urbanization, demanding an urgent response to support youth mental health22.
Investing in adolescent well-being is said to yield a triple dividend
through actions that reduce mortality and disability in adolescence,
prolong healthy life in adulthood, and protect the health of the next generation by educating and strengthening the health of young parents23.
Interventions in urban settings that align with developmental needs
of adolescents and young adults could remediate insults from early
life and establish healthy behaviours and trajectories for adult life19,24,
potentially averting chronic conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the associated mental health, social and physical sequelae25. In fact, investment in a package of adolescent mental
health interventions can yield a 24-fold return in health and economic
benefits26. At the societal level, shaping the aspects of urban life that
influence youth mental health—through services, social policies and
intentional design—could have an enormous impact4. Proposals for
‘restorative urbanism’ that centre mental health, wellness and quality of
life in urban design may move cities in the direction of moulding urban
environments for better adolescent health27,28. Young people, who contribute to the creativity of urban environments and drive movements
for social change29, have a central part to play in this transformation.
Mental Health Friendly Cities, a global multi-stakeholder initiative
led by citiesRISE, mobilizes youth-driven action and systems reform to
promote and sustain the mental health and well-being of young people
in cities around the world30,31 (Supplementary Information). To guide

transformative actions that will enable cities to promote and sustain
adolescent and youth mental health, we studied global priorities for
urban adolescent mental health. One aim of this study is to contribute
data-driven insights that can be used to unite several sectors in cities to act within and across their domains in favour of mental health
promotion and care that is responsive to the needs of young people.
To that end, we administered a series of linked surveys that permitted the influence of ideas from young people and multidisciplinary
domain experts through an anonymous sequential process, following
established methods for research priority setting32.

Framework and top-ranked recommendations
To determine the elements of an urban landscape that would support
mental health for adolescents and youth and would amplify their voices,
we recruited a panel of 518 individuals from 53 countries to participate
in a series of three digitally administered surveys that began in April
2020 (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the panel participation at each round.
In survey 1, panellists responded to the open-ended question: “What
are the characteristics of a mental health-friendly city for young people?”. Analysis of survey 1 data produced 134 statements about mental
health-friendly cities for young people (Methods). In survey 2, participants selected their preferred 40 of the 134 statements. They were also
presented with a second question related to the influence of the COVID19 pandemic on their ideas about youth well-being in cities. In survey
3, we categorized survey 2 statements by socioecological domains
(Fig. 2) and asked panellists to rank-list their preferred statements in
each domain. Before ranking, panellists were required to choose one
of three framings that informed their selected ranking: immediacy of
impact on youth mental health; ability to help youth thrive in cities;
and ease or feasibility of implementation.
We present the findings of the third survey within a socioecological
model (Figs. 3–5) because of this model’s relevance to the combination
of social and environmental exposures in an urban setting and their
interaction with the developing adolescent33. Bronfenbrenner’s model
begins by recognizing that young people’s personal experiences and
development are shaped by their interactions with the people around
them34; that is, they react to and act on their immediate environment
of familial and peer relationships (microlevel). These interpersonal
relationships are also influenced by neighbourhood and community
dynamics and exposure to institutions and policies (mesolevel). These,
in turn, are nested within the organizational, political, historical, cultural (for example, values, norms and beliefs) and physical environments (macrolevel) whose interplay directly or indirectly affects the
adolescent’s mental health and well-being. A high court ruling (policy
environment) could have direct or indirect effects on the community,
household and personal well-being of a young person seeking asylum.
The socioecological framework encompasses the dynamic relationships of an individual with the social environment.

The characteristics
We grouped 37 city characteristics across 6 socioecological domains:
personal, interpersonal, community, organizational, policy and environmental. Figures 3–5 show the mean ranking for each framing and
the total mean ranking averaged across frames. We show, for each
characteristic statement, the number and percentage of panellists
who ranked it highest. The five characteristics in the personal domain
centre on factors that enable healthy emotional maturation for young
people, future orientation and self-reflexivity. Most panellists (53%)
ranked these characteristics according to immediacy of impact on
youth mental health in cities, and mean rankings were identical to
those linked to ability to help youth thrive in cities. The characteristic
that describes prioritizing teaching life skills, providing opportunities
for personal development and providing resources that allow young
people to flourish rose to the top mean rank for each frame and was

also ranked first in this domain by the largest number of panellists
(n = 93). Notably, the characteristic that describes preparing youth to
handle their emotions and overcome challenges was ranked first by 62
panellists, although its mean rank was much lower.
Characteristics in the interpersonal domain refer to young people’s
interactions with others in the environment. Prioritized characteristics
in this domain centred on relationships marked by acceptance and
respect for young people and noted the value of intergenerational
relationships. The top-ranked characteristic emphasized age friendliness and interactions that value the feelings and opinions of young

people as well as safe and healthy relationships. In this domain, ranked
means for characteristics framed according to immediacy of impact on
youth mental health and ability to help youth thrive were the same for
the top two characteristics. Notably, the two highest-ranked means for
ease of implementation focused on opportunities for safe and healthy
relationships and strengthening intergenerational relationships.

relationships. Study participants prioritized access to safe spaces for

domain of community, and rankings were identical for each framing.
At the organizational domain, two characteristics shared high mean
rankings: employment opportunities that allow job security and
satisfaction and a responsive and supportive educational system.
Health-care services and educational services were the organizations
most frequently referenced in relation to youth mental health. Whereas
employment opportunities ranked first in terms of feasibility of implementation, provision of youth-friendly health services ranked first for
immediacy of impact on youth mental health. With the exception of
the community and organizational domains, more panellists chose
to frame their responses in terms of immediacy of impact on youth
mental health.
Of the four statements in the policy domain, the design and planning
of cities with youth input and gender sensitivity ranked highest overall
and was most frequently ranked first by panellists (30.68%). Promoting
democratic cooperation and equal opportunity and anti-discrimination
in all institutions received the highest mean rank for feasibility of implementation.
The sixth socioecological domain lists 13 characteristics related to
the social, cultural and physical environments. Addressing adverse
social determinants of health for young people had the highest overall
ranked mean; however, normalizing youth seeking mental health care
and addressing service gaps ranked first when framed by feasibility of
implementation and immediacy of impact. Having access to affordable
basic amenities was most frequently ranked first in this domain by
panellists, but panellist preferences were distributed across the list.

COVID-19 and urban youth well-being
Our data collection began in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, and by survey 2 (August 2020), most countries were experiencing the pandemic’s public health, social and economic effects. In
light of this, we added an open-ended survey question to which 255
participants responded “How has the COVID-19 pandemic changed
your ideas about the wellbeing of young people in cities?” (Methods).
Most respondents reported changes in perspective or new emphases
on inequities as determinants of youth well-being and mental health,
whereas nine reported that COVID-19 did not change their ideas. For
one such respondent (in the >35 years age category), the pandemic

merely confirmed the powerful effect of social vulnerabilities on risk
and outcomes during an emergency: “COVID-19 has not changed my
ideas about the wellbeing of young people in cities. I found that the
young people in cities who did well during the lockdown period and
the difficult period of the pandemic were those who were already doing
well in terms of a rich social network, good interpersonal relations
with family and friends, enjoyable work life, a close religious network,
membership [in] a young people’s club so that they were able to stay
connected via social media. Those who had access to food and essential
commodities and those who knew they would return to school or work
after the pandemic. Those who had access to good living conditions
and some space for recreation also did well. ... The impact of COVID19
was felt much more by those with existing mental health conditions,
living in crowded slums, poverty, unemployment, who were uncertain
about the next step”.
Respondents highlighted losses young people experienced as a result
of the pandemic. These included loss of the city as a place of opportunity; loss of jobs, familial and individual income, and economic stability;
loss of a planned future and loss of certainty; loss of rites of passage
of youth; loss of access to friends, social networks and social support;
loss of access to quality education and to health care, especially mental
health care and sexual and reproductive health services; loss of opportunities for psychological and social development; and loss of loved
ones who died from COVID-19. We summarize the qualitative findings
according to the socioecological framework. We present sample quotes
in Table 2, along with the age category of the respondents (18–24, 25–35
and >35) and actions for cities to take.

Governance and equity. Freedom from discrimination and the value of
equity were listed among the mental health-friendly city characteristics;
however, respondents pointed out the dearth of equity that COVID-19
unveiled (see the first quote in Table 2).
Respondents observed that policy responses to COVID-19, including
mandated curfews and quarantines, shifted the social and economic
environment of cities. Young people and their families lost economic

opportunities, and cities also became less affordable during the pandemic. Participants explained that poverty and job loss worsened young
people’s mental health and well-being and exposed youth to more risk
factors because they needed to “hustle or work to place food on the
table”. The loss of jobs also deprived youth of hope and underlined the
economic inequities that some felt marked their generation more than
previous ones. One participant (18–24) reported “Before, I used to think
youths need someone who can understand them, empathize with them,
but looking at the current scenario, I feel youths need security and a
hopeful future too”. In some settings, these economic shifts resulted
in an exodus from cities. A respondent (18–24) observed “Cities have
always attracted young people but since the pandemic started the
cost of living has gone from being a barrier to being another factor in
encouraging young people to leave”.

accessible. Participants alluded to cramped urban housing, crowded
slums and poor housing infrastructure as stressors that the availability
of safe public spaces alleviated. Green space in particular provided
solace for young people. A participant (18–24) responded “It’s difficult
when you’re confined to the limited space especially when you’re not
closer to nature. Negative thoughts get you one way or another even
if you try your best. Pandemic has caused more depression I reckon
among the youths”. Accessible green space was highlighted as a need
and an area for investing effort and policy change (Table 2). A desire
for clean, youth-friendly green space for safe gathering and recreation
was contrasted with unplanned land use and confined spaces, the latter
of which some participants linked to greater risks for young people.

Urban built environment. For those who remained in the city, the urban
built environment could also offer respite from pandemic-related
restrictions in mobility when green spaces and other open spaces were

Community and organizations
Respondents reported diminished access to education and health care,
and a disregard of young people’s needs by decision-makers (Table 2).
Some responses criticized the lack of forethought before the pandemic to budget for and provide supportive learning environments

for youth of all socioeconomic strata. The closure of schools generated stress for young people with the disruption of routines and
opportunities to socialize. The pandemic generated greater uncertainty about job opportunities and future trajectories. At the same
time, the pandemic brought opportunities to position youth as either
contributors and leaders or detractors from community life. Young
people reflected on how they experienced inclusion, empathy and
exclusion, as well as opportunity for leadership. One respondent
(25–35) commented “Our worlds are changing and with it many of
our expectations about our education, work, personal interactions
and relationships. Instead of being met with understanding, we are
collectively positioned as transgressors of social distancing in a way
that fails to understand that we are often incredibly vulnerable in this
new world and left exposed by lack of infrastructure, service provision
and support”.
A respondent (18–24) noticed possibilities for involving young people in responses that could mitigate their numerous losses: “Given the
opportunities and resources, young people can be a carrier of change
and wellbeing if adults trust them enough to be”.

Interpersonal domain
Getting through difficult times required interpersonal supports:
connectedness through in-person encounters in safe spaces, complemented by digital interactions. Multiple respondents emphasized
the relationship between social isolation and poor mental health
among city youth during the pandemic, noting the difficulty of making
142 | Nature | Vol 627 | 7 March 2024

meaningful connection during a time of physical isolation. Two young
respondents (18–24) said the well-being of young people was linked to
being “in a group of people”, which provides “safety and unity”, and to
“inclusion, activity, and interpersonal relationships”. Space repeatedly
emerged as a theme, as a conduit to facilitate social connection for
young people without risk of COVID-19 transmission, violence, sexual
abuse or exposure to drug use. Some participants called for greater
investment in creating strong, safe virtual communities for young
people; however, although participants identified virtual spaces as a
resource for mental health support, a young panellist (18–24) remarked
of social media and technology that “It isolated people, even though
we have … ways of staying connected 24/7, we still feel lonely.”

Personal
Consistent with the lead mental health-friendly city characteristic in
the personal domain (Figs. 3–5), the pandemic prompted realization
of the need for personal skills development to support youth mental
well-being. Some respondents expressed concern about the loss of
social skills among young people as a result of confinement and an
18–24-year-old commented “… Youths are in that stage where they
need to be equipped with skills to promote positive mental wellbeing”. Another young person (18–24) remarked “Most of us do not really
have the capacity and necessary skills to support each other when it
comes to mental health”. Participants described the importance of
being prepared for unpredictable circumstances and enabling youth
to “manage themselves, their emotions, and wellbeing”.

Pandemic-related gains
In some cases, the pandemic brought positive experiences for young
people, including more time for self-reflection and discovery, engaging in healing practices, more opportunities to connect with friends,
and overall, a greater societal and individual focus on strengthening
mental health. A participant (25–35) referred to young people: “They are
more conscious about health and their wellbeing by reducing workload
and connecting with nature”. Others believed the pandemic revealed
young people’s capacity to adapt and to consider the needs of their
elders. Some viewed the social justice uprisings that occurred in many
countries as a positive vehicle for change and cooperation with others. Changing these conditions would require longer-term solutions:
strengthening urban infrastructure and addressing the underlying
drivers of inequity. Another participant (>35) lauded the power of youth
activism: “… the pandemic has shown us that the resilience of youth is
great, as well as the commitment and solidarity with their communities
through volunteering, advocacy and youth mobilization”.

Discussion
Our study convened a multinational and multidisciplinary panel of
researchers, practitioners, advocates and young people to identify the

characteristics of a mental health-friendly city for youths. The characteristics are distributed among six socioecological domains (Figs. 3–5)
that encompass the personal development of young people, supportive
educational systems, people-centred health care, a built environment responsive to the needs of young people, and equity-focused
policy-making and governance. Within each of these domains, the
characteristics we identified are associated with an evolving evidence
base linked to youth mental health outcomes and to potential policy
intervention.
Intrapersonal characteristics in our list underline the centrality of
enabling young people to cultivate skills to manage their interior lives.
The targets of such skills-building activities align with proposed ‘active
ingredients’ of mental health interventions, such as intervention components related to mechanisms of action or clinical effects on depressive or anxiety symptoms35. Examples include affective awareness skills
that enable young people to differentiate and describe emotions36 and
emotion regulation skills to increase and maintain positive emotions37.
Youth-friendly mental health and educational services, a priority theme
at the community level of the framework, could support the intrapersonal realm by deploying a variety of interventions for self-control that
benefit adolescent and young adult academic, behavioural and social
functioning38. Such interventions can also be implemented in earlier
childhood educational settings through integration into the curriculum

Actions to support

Governance and equity

“The pandemic has shone a brighter light on all the infrastructural and societal issues we have been
generally aware of for a long time, but for which perhaps a renewed energy should be exerted … It showed
that our education system is underprepared to serve diverse needs and is mostly geared to cater to those
with the most privilege. It shows that our higher education system is highly funded by unpaid Black and
brown young people performing on fields, courts and arenas for wealthy people’s entertainment. It reveals
that society is willing to risk some lives called ‘essential workers’ who are mostly BIPOC and low income.
Especially, it reveals that during times of high stress societally, decision makers seem to let go of issues
related to equity.” (>35).
“… One cannot separate the impact of the pandemic from the nationwide calls for justice and how the issues
of racism further threaten our youth’s mental wellbeing. After reading all 134 characteristics below, I see
there is no mention of a MHFC for youth having institutions and leaders who work to dismantle the systems
of oppression and racism that cause ongoing and significant harm to our youth’s mental wellbeing.” (>35).

Dismantle systems of
oppression and racism

Social norms and
protections

“Implementation of initial lockdown measures forced youth along with children, adults and families to
move from big cities to villages due to lack of minimum social welfare, employment and increasing hunger,
homelessness etc. Labelled as ‘migrants’, cities were not able to guarantee and uphold basic rights for all
youth, especially vulnerable groups. Many young people were forced to travel long distances on foot due to
lack of transport or any other amenities.” (25–35).

Resourced built
environment

“I believe that young people and city officials have had a re-awakening when it comes to the need for open
& public spaces in cities. There is certainly not enough open space in urban settings. Young people need
access to parks and open space. These spaces provide opportunities for youth to connect with themselves
as individuals, with other youth, and with the community.” (25–35).
“The pandemic has highlighted the need for more creative green spaces in cities along with more
accessibility. Closing parks at certain hours is a very uncomfortable public policy. Nature should not align
with strict schedules designed by those who may not even use the spaces. Nature should have unlimited
access.” (>35).

“There’s little or no access to mental health care for young people, even virtual services. Many young people
lost loved ones to the virus at periods when hospitals and counseling centers were shut down. There were
hardly any mass media messages providing psychological support for them or directing them to virtual
access to psychological first-aid. There’s still low awareness of the scope of care and support they can
get from mental health experts … Prevention activities are focused mainly on adults and the elderly, and
children. Most messages created were hardly directed specifically at young people. Apparently, adolescents
and young adults are still a ‘forgotten’ group of the society. Even if they were prone to the health issues or
complications, they were hardly targeted specifically with health-related messages.” (>35).
“I think short courses on crisis intervention and adaptation techniques could be implemented throughout
the curriculum from as early as age twelve.” (18–24).

“We need safe online spaces for peers to connect (including crisis support in those spaces). I can also

“Individuals have the power within themselves. Wellness is a purposeful thing done by coercion of the
human will in the ever changing environment in order to attain its highest potential. Youths are in that stage
where they need to be equipped with skills to promote positive mental wellbeing.” (18–24).

or through other community-based medical or social service organizations39. Interventions implemented in selected high-income settings
include Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies40, the Incredible
Years41 and Family Check-up42. For young adults, interventions that
convey skills to alleviate common psychological problems such as
procrastination, perfectionism, low self-esteem, test anxiety and stress
could potentially reduce the prevalence of specific mental health conditions while possibly providing acceptable and non-stigmatizing options
for care43,44.
Our data suggest that a defining theme of any mental health-friendly
city for youth is the quality of young people’s social fabric and the
city’s ability to provide young people with the skills, opportunities
and places required to build and maintain healthy social relationships
with their peers, across generations, and as members of a community. The relationships of concern in the interpersonal realm have
intrinsic value for healthy adolescent and youth development, promoting well-being45 and prevention of depression46,47. Panellists also
linked opportunities to socialize and build social networks to the
availability of safe spaces, the top-ranked priority in the community
144 | Nature | Vol 627 | 7 March 2024

domain. Achieving safety necessitates equitable and violence-free
institutions and cities48, a priority that panellists ranked first for
ease of implementation in the policy domain. Thus, policies and
legislation are required that reduce neglect, bullying, harassment,
abuse, censorship, exposure to violence and a wide range of threats
towards young people, from homelessness to crime to intimidation
by officials48,49.
Exposure to community violence and household violence consistently worsens mental health outcomes for youth50–53; successful reduction of urban violence should be prioritized. Equity-focused responses
to safety needs should include reducing discriminatory physical and
structural violence against young people based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or mental health status, which place youth at risk of harmful exposures: rape or trafficking of adolescent girls or police killings
of North American Black youth. To create urban spaces in which young
people can experience safety, freedom and belongingness requires
approaches that actively prevent discrimination54 and that consider
young people’s multiple identities in the design of institutional as well
as outdoor spaces. Women-only parks create greater security for girls

and young women and potentially more positive social interaction in
some settings55.
The benefits of green space, measured as self-satisfaction for adolescents, are linked to greater social contact (for example, more close
friends), underscoring space as a conduit for social connection55. The
advantages of healthy urban spaces for adolescents have emerged not
only in health sciences research but also in allied fields such as urban
design and sociology27,56,57. Urban spaces with opportunities for active
commute options to and from school are associated with increased
physical activity and environmental supportiveness58. Similarly, the
presence of community spaces, such as town centres, is associated with
improved social connectedness and sense of belonging59.
The critical importance of social connectedness was reinforced in the
COVID-19 responses. Yet, in many cities the pandemic eliminated spaces
that foster urban conviviality, often with lasting effects60. Restricted
movement and COVID-19 transmission risk associated with public
transport may have contributed to greater stress for urban dwellers and
ongoing reluctance to use these services61. Such factors contribute to
social isolation, which may persist in the near term. Consistent with our
COVID-19 data, responses from a sample of Australian youth identified
social isolation, interrupted education and work, and uncertainty about
the future among the primary negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic62.
In several studies, loneliness increased the risk of mental health conditions among young people during prior epidemics; of relevance to
the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration of loneliness predicted future
mental health problems63.
Analysis of our survey 2 data revealed differences in the priorities of
young participants (18–24 and 25–35) compared with panellists over age
35. This discrepancy could have implications for urban decision-makers
whose plans to implement positive actions on behalf of young people may not align with what is most salient for youth. Thus, youth
involvement in policy development is even more crucial. Soliciting
youth perspectives about what supports their mental health based on
their personal experiences could simplify and improve interventions
intended for them64. Several actions could facilitate meaningful youth
engagement in governance: encourage collaboration between governments and youth organizations to co-create and co-lead national action
plans; implement mechanisms within global governance organizations
for youth consultation at local, national and international levels; require
inclusion of young people on relevant conference agendas; and improve
access to funding for youth-led organizations65,66.
Notably, the themes of equity and elimination of discrimination due
to race, gender, sexual orientation and neurodiversity arose frequently
in the responses to the survey and the COVID-19 question, as did the
adversities to which minoritized groups are vulnerable (for example, community violence, police violence and bullying; Figs. 4 and 5).
A city that is free of discrimination and racism ranked first among policy
responses with immediacy of impact on the mental health of youth—
even though no statements proposed dismantling systems of oppression that underlie racism and discrimination, as one respondent noted
(Fig. 4). Globally, racism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination increase mortality and harm the mental health of affected groups
through stress-related physiological responses, harmful environmental
exposures and limited access to opportunities and health services20,67–69.
Embedded racist and xenophobic norms, policies and practices of
institutions—including those that govern educational, labour and health
care systems—yield racialized outcomes for young people around the
world (for example, high incidence of HIV infection among adolescent
girls in southern sub-Saharan Africa)20. To disrupt these forces requires
multiple approaches, including recognition and remedy of historical
injustices, the activism of social movements committed to change, and
implementation of legal frameworks based in human rights norms70.
When participants ranked characteristics for ease of implementation (Figs. 3–5), they coalesced around a broad set of factors demonstrating the need for collaboration across urban sectors (for example,

normalizing seeking mental health care, promoting democratic cooperation and equal opportunity, and creating employment opportunities
and progressive educational systems). This need for cooperation is
perhaps most apparent for actions that increase equity. Successful cooperation requires a clear, shared vision and mission, allocation of funding
in each sector, diversity of funding sources, distributed decision-making
and authority across sectors, and policies that facilitate collaboration71.
However, well-intentioned cross-sectoral responses to urban needs may
inadvertently increase inequities by designing programmes influenced
by market forces that magnify environmental privilege (that is, unequal
exposure to environmental problems according to social privilege)54.
Examples include gentrification and development that use land to
create green spaces but further dislocate and marginalize communities in need of affordable housing54. Implementing community- and
youth-partnered processes for urban health equity policy co-creation
could yield unified agendas and help to circumvent inequitable outcomes54,72. A mental health-friendly city must be positioned to support,
integrate and enable the thriving of marginalized and vulnerable young
people of the society, who should be involved in its governance.

Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. First, this priority-setting study
yielded a rich dataset of recommended characteristics of a mental
health-friendly city for young people from a globally diverse panel of
more than 480 individuals from 53 countries. Second, we welcomed
expertise from participants with roles relevant to urban sectors:
researchers, policymakers and practice-based participants, and we
engaged young people in the study advisory board and as study participants, capitalizing on their lived experience. Third, we captured information about how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced participants’
ideas about urban adolescent mental health. Fourth, to our knowledge,
this is the first study that brings together a large and multidisciplinary
set of stakeholders concerned for cities (for example, urban designers)
and for youth mental health (for example, teachers and health professionals) to identify priorities for intersectoral action.
Our study also has several limitations. First, the participants recruited
do not reflect the full social and economic diversity of urban populations whom city governments and decision-makers must serve. Our
decision to use a web-based format following standard health research
priority-setting methods required tradeoffs. We sought disciplinary,
age and geographic diversity; however, our sample does not represent
the most marginalized groups of adolescents or adults. Rather, the
recruitment of academics, educators, leaders and well-networked
young people through an online study probably minimizes the number
of participants living in adversity. Although we also recruited young
people who were not necessarily established experts, many were students or members of advocacy or international leadership networks
and were not likely to exemplify the most disadvantaged groups. We
risk masking the specific viewpoints or needs of marginalized and
at-risk young people. However, we are reassured by the prominence of
equity as a theme and the call to address social determinants of health.
Second, it is possible that participants recruited through the authors’
professional networks may be more likely to reflect the viewpoints of
the advisory committee members who selected them, given collaborative or other professional relationships. This may have shaped the
range of responses and their prioritization. Third, the aspirational calls
for an end to discrimination and inequalities highlighted in our results
require confronting long-standing structural inequities both within
and between countries. Structural violence frequently maintains these
power imbalances. Although we do not view their aspirational nature as
a limitation, we note that our study data do not outline the complexity
of responses required to address these determinants of mental health
or to dismantle discriminatory structures. Fourth, our data present
several aggregated characteristics that may require disaggregation

Considerations for implementing a mental health-friendly city for
youth
Considerations for implementing a mental health-friendly city for
youth using a structure adapted from UNICEF’s strategic framework
for the second decade of life82 and integrating selected
characteristics identified in the study with examples distilled from
scientific literature and from project advisory group members.
Objectives for implementation along with corresponding examples
and selected initiatives are shown.
Objectives
• Youth are equipped with resources and skills for personal and
emotional development, compassion, self-acceptance, and
flourishing.
• Youth develop and sustain safe, healthy relationships and strong
intergenerational bonds in age-friendly settings that respect,
value and validate them.
• Communities promote youth integration and participation in all
areas of community life.
• Communities establish and maintain safe, free public spaces for
youth socializing, learning and connection.
• Institutions facilitate satisfying, secure employment;
progressive, inclusive, violence-free education; skills for mental
health advocacy and peer support.
• Policies support antiracist, gender equitable, non-discriminatory
cities that promote democratic cooperation and non-violence.
• Urban environments provide safe, reliable infrastructure for
basic amenities and transportation; affordable housing; access
to green and blues space; and access to recreation and art.
• Cities minimize adverse social determinants of health; design for
safety and security for vulnerable groups; and orient social and
built environments to mental health promotion, belonging and
purpose.

Principles
• Use rights-based approaches
• Prioritize equity for racially, ethnically, gender, sexually and
neurologically diverse young people
• Ensure sustained and authentic participation of youth
Platforms
• Schools and other educational settings
• Health and social services
• Families and communities
• Religious and spiritual institutions
• Child protection and justice systems
• Peer groups
• Civil society
• Digital and non-digital media

as cities contextualize the findings for their settings. Fifth, our network recruitment strategy led to skewed recruitment from some geographic regions (for example, North America and Nepal), which may
have biased responses (Extended Data Figs. 1–3). Extended Data Table 1
shows the similarities and differences in the rankings for Nepal, USA
and the remaining countries in survey 3. Additionally, we recruited
few 14–17-year-olds. We experienced attrition over the three rounds of
surveying, ending with complete responses from 261 individuals from
48 countries, with the greatest loss in participants between surveys 1

Implementation objectives
• Build consensus and contextualize the mental health-friendly
city approach at local, regional, national levels
• Engage diverse youth in co-design of mental health-friendly city
plans
• Expand opportunities for youth governance
• Enable collaboration among sectors for policy alignment
• Engage communities, schools, health services, media for
intervention delivery
• Legislate social protection policies
• Scale interventions to improve economic and behavioral
outcomes
• Link implementation to achievement of national or international
objectives
Selected implementation strategies
• Youth co-design and participation: Growing Up Boulder is an
initiative to create more equitable and sustainable communities
in which young people participate and influence issues
that affect them. It is a partnership between local schools,
universities,
local government, businesses and local non-profit organizations
in the USA that has enabled young people to formally participate
in visioning processes such as community assessments,
mapping, photo documentation and presentations to city
representatives83.
• Engaging schools for interventions: universal school-based
interventions for mental health promotion84; linkage to mental
health care for school-based programs85; “Whole-school
approaches” that engage students and families, communities,
and other agencies to support mental health and improve
academic outcomes84,86.
• Digital platforms for youth mental health: Chile’s HealthyMind
Initiative digital platform launched during the COVID-19
pandemic and provided a one-stop resource for information and
digital mental health services. The platform included targeted
evidence-based resources for children and adolescents87.
• Interventions to test at scale: Stepping Stones and Creating
Futures is a community-based intervention for intimate partner
violence reduction and strengthening livelihoods in urban
informal settlements in South Africa that reduced young men’s
perpetration of intimate partner violence and increased women’s
earning power88.
• Shared international objectives: support Sustainable
Development Goal 11 and New Urban Agenda targets and
Sustainable Development Goals 1–6, 8, 10 and 16.

and 2 (Table 1), among the 14–17-, 18–24- and 25–35-year-old age groups,
and among participants from Nepal (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Conclusions
We identified a set of priorities for cities that require intervention
at multiple levels and across urban sectors. A clear next step could
involve convenings to build national or regional consensus around local
priorities and plans to engage stakeholders to co-design implementation

of the most salient characteristics of a mental health-friendly city for
youth in specific cities (Box 1). It is likely that many variables (for example, geography, politics, culture, race, ethnicity and sexual identity) will
shape priorities in each city. Therefore, essential to equitable action is
ensuring that an inclusive community of actors is at the table formulating and making decisions, and that pathways for generating knowledge
of mental health-friendly city characteristics remain open. This includes
representation of sectors beyond mental health that operate at the
intersection of areas prioritized by young people. Preparing for implementation will require avenues for youth participation and influence
through collective action, social entrepreneurship and representation
in national, regional and community decision-making. Enlisting the
participation of youth networks that bring young people marginalized
owing to sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, economic status, ethnicity or caste; young people with disabilities; and youth and adults with
lived experience of mental health conditions in the design of mental
health-friendly cities will help to level power imbalances and increase
the likelihood that cities meet their needs.
Action for adolescent mental health aligns well with actions nations
should take to achieve development targets, and collective action to
draw attention to these areas of synergy could benefit youth and cities.
Specifically, supporting the mental health of young people aligns with
Sustainable Development Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities)
and the New Urban Agenda that aims to “ensure sustainable and inclusive urban economies, to end poverty and to ensure equal rights and
opportunities … and integration into the urban space”73–75.
Additionally, the list of mental health-friendly city characteristics
presents a starting point for strengthening the evidence base on intervening at multiple levels (for example, individual, family, community,
organizations and environment) to better understand what works for
which youth in which settings. Cities function as complex systems, and
systems-centred research can best enable us to understand how individuals’ interactions with one another and with their environments influence good or poor mental health76. Similarly, interdisciplinary inquiry is
needed that investigates urban precarity and sheds light on social interventions for youth mental health77. New research that tests implementation strategies and measures mental health outcomes of coordinated
cross-sectoral interventions in cities could be integrated with planned
actions. Innovative uses of data that measure the ‘racial opportunity
gap’ can help cities to understand how race and place interact to reduce
economic well-being for minoritized young people on their trajectory to
adulthood78. Even heavily studied relationships, such as mental health
and green space, can benefit from new methodologies for measuring
exposures, including application of mixed methods, and refined characterization of outcomes by gender and age with a focus on adolescents and
youth79. Globally, mental health-supporting actions for young people in
urban areas have an incomplete evidence base, with more peer-reviewed
publications skewed towards North American research73.
Designing mental health-friendly cities for young people is possible. It requires policy approaches that facilitate systemic, sustained
intersectoral commitments at the global as well as local levels80. It also
requires creative collaboration across multiple sectors because the
characteristics identified range from transport to housing to employment to health, with a central focus on social and economic equity.
Acting on these characteristics demands coordinated investment,
joint planning and decision-making among urban sectoral leaders, and
strategic deployment of human and financial resources across local
government departments that shape city life and resources75,81. This
process will be more successful when cities intentionally and accountably implement plans to dismantle structural racism and other forms
of discrimination to provide equitable access to economic and educational opportunities for young people, with the goal of eliminating
disparate health and social outcomes. The process is made easier when
diverse stakeholders identify converging interests and interventions
that allow them each to achieve their goals.

Methods
Project structure and launch
This study aimed to identify priorities for creating cities that promote
and sustain adolescent and youth mental health. Central to achieving
this aim was our goal of engaging a multidisciplinary, global, age-diverse
group of stakeholders. As we began and throughout the study, we
were cognizant of the risk of attrition, the importance of maintaining
multidisciplinary participation throughout the study and the value of
preserving the voices of young people. We used a priority-setting methodology explicitly aimed to be inclusive while simultaneously limiting
study attrition. To ensure that we were inclusive of the voices of young
people and our large and diverse sample, we limited our study to three
surveys, which we determined a priori. Our approach was informed by
standard methodologies for health research priority setting32.
The project was led by a collaborative team from the University of
Washington Consortium for Global Mental Health, Urban@UW, the
University of Melbourne and citiesRISE. We assembled three committees representing geographic, national, disciplinary, gender and
age diversity to guide the work. First, a core team of P.Y.C., T.W., G.P.,
M.S. and T.C., generated an initial list of recommended members of
the scientific advisory board on the basis of their research and practice
activities related to adolescent mental health or the urban setting. We
sought a multidisciplinary group representing relevant disciplines.
The 18-member scientific advisory board, comprising global leaders
in urban design and architecture, social entrepreneurship, education,
mental health and adolescent development, provided scientific guidance. We invited members of an executive committee, who represented
funding agencies as well as academic and non-governmental organizational leadership, to provide a second level of feedback. A youth
advisory board, recruited through citiesRISE youth leaders and other
global mental health youth networks, comprised global youth leaders in mental health advocacy. A research team from the University
of Washington (Urban@UW, the University of Washington Population Health Initiative and the University of Washington Consortium
for Global Mental Health) provided study coordination. The study
received institutional review board approval at the University of Washington (STUDY00008502). Invitations to advisory groups were sent
in December 2019, along with a concept note describing the aims of
the project, and committee memberships were confirmed in January
2020. In February 2020, the committees formulated the question for
survey 1: “What are the characteristics of a mental health friendly city
for young people?”.
Study recruitment
The members of the scientific advisory board, youth advisory board and
executive committee were invited to nominate individuals with expertise across domains relevant to urban life and adolescent well-being.
The group recommended 763 individuals to join the priority-setting
panel; individuals invited to serve on the scientific advisory board,
youth advisory board and executive committee were included in panel
invitations (n = 38). Our goal was to establish a geographically diverse
panel of participants with scientific, policy and practice-based expertise corresponding to major urban sectors and related challenges (for
example, health, education, urban planning and design, youth and
criminal justice, housing and homelessness, and violence). Many of the
nominees were experts with whom the core group and scientific advisory board members had collaborated, as well as individuals recruited
on the basis of their participation in professional and scientific associations and committees (for example, Lancet Commissions and Series)
or global practice networks (for example, Teach for All). Nominees’
names, the advisory member who nominated them, gender, country
and discipline were tracked by T.C. We used snowball sampling to recruit
participants from geographic regions that were under-represented: an
additional 24 people were recruited through referrals. The scientific

advisory board and youth advisory board sought to maximize the
number of young people participating in the study, and invitations
were extended to adolescents and young adults through educational,
professional, advocacy and advisory networks. Nominees received an
invitation letter by e-mail, accompanied by a concept note that introduced the study, defined key constructs, described the roles of the
study advisory groups and provided an estimated study timeline. Youth
participants (14–24) received a more abbreviated introductory letter.
A link to a REDCap survey with an informed consent form and round
1 question was embedded in the invitation e-mail, which was offered
in English and Spanish. Of the 824 individuals invited, 518 individuals
from 53 countries provided informed consent and agreed to participate,
resulting in a nomination acceptance rate of 62.8%.

Data collection
We administered a series of three sequential surveys using REDCap
version 9.8.2. Panellists were asked to respond to the survey 1 question
“What are the characteristics of a mental health friendly city for young
people?” by providing up to five characteristics and were invited to use
as much space as needed. In survey 2, panellists received 134 characteristic statements derived from survey 1 data and were asked to select
their 40 most important statements. From these data, we selected 40
most frequently ranked statements. These were presented in the round
3 survey with three redundant statements removed. The remaining 37
characteristic statements were categorized across 6 socioecological
domains and panellists were asked to select 1 of 3 framings by which
to rank the statements in each domain: immediacy of impact on youth
mental health in cities, ability to help youth thrive in cities, and ease
or feasibility of implementation. Of individuals who consented to participate, 93.4% completed round 1, 58.5% completed round 2 and 56.2%
completed round 3 (Table 1).
We added a new open-ended question to survey 2: “How has the
COVID-19 pandemic changed your ideas about the wellbeing of young
people in cities?”. Panellists were invited to respond using as many
characters (that is, as much space) as needed.
Data analysis
Three-survey series. We managed the survey 1 data using ATLAS.ti 8
software for qualitative data analysis and conducted a conventional
content analysis of survey 1 data89. Given the multidisciplinarity of
the topic and our multidisciplinary group of respondents, we selected
an inductive method of analysis to reflect, as simply as possible, the
priorities reported by the study sample without imposing disciplinary
frameworks. In brief, responses were read multiple times, and characteristics were highlighted in the text. A list of characteristics (words and
phrases) was constructed, and we coded the data according to emerging categories (for example, accessibility, basic amenities, career, built
environment, mental health services and so on). The analysis yielded
19 broad categories with 423 characteristics. Within each category,
characteristics were grouped into statements that preserved meaning
while streamlining the list, which yielded 134 characteristic statements.
The University of Washington research team convened a 1-week series
of data discussions with youth advisers to review the wording of the
characteristics and ensure their comprehensibility among readers
from different countries. The survey 1 categorized data were reviewed
by members of the scientific advisory board, who recommended that
using relevant domains to group characteristics would provide meaningful context to the final list. We used IBM SPSS 28.0 for quantitative
analyses of data from surveys 2 and 3. In survey 2, we analysed the frequency of endorsement of the 40 characteristics selected by panellists
and generated a ranked list of all responses, with the most frequently
endorsed at the top. The decision to select 40 characteristics aligned
with methods applied in a previous priority-setting exercise90 and permitted a list of preferred characteristics that could subsequently be categorized according to a known framework, allowing city stakeholders

Analysis
a broad list from which to select actions. We also analysed frequency
of endorsement by age categories (18–24, 25–35 and >35). To amplify
the viewpoints of younger participants (under age 35), we combined
the top 25 characteristic statements of panellists over 35 with the top
26 characteristic statements of participants under 35 to generate a list
of 40 statements, including 11 shared ranked characteristics. As noted,
we removed three of these statements because of their redundancy. In
survey 3, we analysed data consisting of 37 characteristic statements
divided across 6 socioecological domains. Characteristics in each domain were ranked according to one of three framings. We calculated
mean ranking and standard deviation for characteristics in each framing
category per socioecological domain. Mean rankings (with standard
deviation) were calculated across framing categories to arrive at the
total mean rank per characteristic and they reflect the proportional
contribution of each domain. We also calculated the frequency with
which panellists ranked each characteristic statement number 1.
Our study methods align with good practices for health research
priority setting as follows32.
• Context: we defined a clear focus of the study.
• Use of a comprehensive approach: we outlined methods, time frame
and intentions for the results before beginning the study; however,
we modified (that is, simplified) the methods for survey 3 to minimize
study attrition.
• Inclusiveness: we prioritized recruiting for broad representation
and maintaining engagement of an inclusive participant group, and
methodological decisions were made in service of this priority.
• Information gathering: our reviews of the literature showed that a
study bringing together these key stakeholders had not been conducted, despite the need.
• Planning for implementation: we recognized from the outset that
additional convening at regional levels would be required to implement action, and our network members are able to move the agenda
forwards.
• Criteria: we determined criteria for the priorities (framing: feasibility
of implementation, immediacy of impact and ability to help youth
thrive) that study participants used and which we believe will be useful
for practical implementation.
• Methods for deciding on priorities: we determined that rank order
would be used to determine priorities.
• Evaluation: not applicable; we have not planned an evaluation of the
impact of priority setting in this phase of work.
• Transparency: the manuscript preparation, review and revisions
enable us to present findings with transparency.
COVID-19 qualitative data. We managed the COVID-19 qualitative
data using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. We carried out a rapid
qualitative analysis91. First, the text responses were read and re-read
multiple times. We coded the data for content related to expressions
of change, no change or areas of emphasis in participants’ perceptions
of youth mental health in cities during the pandemic. We focused our
attention on data that highlighted changes. We further segmented the
data by participant age categories, domains of change and suggested
actions, and we assigned socioecological level of changes. We created
a matrix using excerpted or highlighted text categorized according
to these categories. Three data analysts (P.Y.C., T.C. and A.M.-K.)
reviewed the domains of change and identified emerging themes, which
were added to the matrix and linked to quotes. The team discussed the
themes and came to consensus on assignment to a socioecological level.

We prioritized reporting recurring concepts (for example, themes of
loss, inequity, green space, isolation and mental illnesses) and contrasting concepts (for example, gains associated with COVID-19) and
associated actions92.

Study description

The study is a sequential, multi-survey priority-setting exercise comprising two open-ended survey questions that provided
qualitative data and 2 structured surveys that permitted quantification of the results.

Research sample

The study sample comprises children (age 14-17 yrs) and adults (18 yrs and older) representing 53 countries.

Sampling strategy

We recruited individuals with practice-based, policy, research expertise and/or lived experience as a young person under the age of
35 through nominations submitted by the project's Scientific Advisory Board. To improve geographic diversity, we used snowball
sampling to ensure participation from specific regions. Because the aim of the study was to achieve input and determine priorities
from diverse stakeholders, we did not predetermine sample size.

Data collection

Participants were contacted vis email, provided details about the study, and invited to give informed consent for participation in a 3round survey via REDCap. Participants responded to open-ended questions in the first and second surveys, and they responded to
structured survey questions in the second and third surveys using REDCap.

Timing

Data collection began in April 2020 and ended in December 2020. The first survey period occurred from April-May 2020, the second
from August to September 2020, and the third from November - December 2020.

Data exclusions

No data were excluded.

Non-participation

825 participants were invited to participate, 307 did not respond. 518 people accepted the invitation, 484 submitted Survey 1 data,
303 submitted Survey 2 data (215, no response), 291 submitted Survey 3 data (227, no response). We did not collect data on reasons
for non-participation or drop-out.

Randomization

The study did not involve randomization.
